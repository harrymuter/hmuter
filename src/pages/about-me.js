              I was born in East London, but relocated to Norwich with my family
              in 2004, where I attended{" "}
              <a href="https://townclose.com/">Town Close School</a> and then{" "}
              <a href="https://langleyschool.co.uk/">Langley School</a>. For my
              A-Levels I selected a wide range of subjects, studying
              Mathematics, Business Studies and Photography. After finishing
              school I enrolled to study Business Information Systems at the{" "}
              <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/">
                University of East Anglia &#40;UEA&#41;
              </a>
              , beginning in September 2014.

              I was drawn to my undergraduate course due to its
              interdisciplinary nature as I wished to gain a rounded knowledge
              of fundamental business principles, as well as practical software
              development skills. I graduated in July 2017, with First Class
              Honours before deciding to specialise in data science by enrolling
              on the{" "}
              <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/postgraduate/msc-data-science">
                MSc Knowledge Discovery and Datamining course
              </a>{" "}
              at UEA .

              Upon graduating from my MSc with Merit, I gained a role at{" "}
              <a href="https://www.aviva.com/">Aviva</a>. Whilst there, I was
              responsible for the maintenance, development, and testing of the
              underwriting and pricing algorithms for Aviva's commercial
              products.

              After two years of industry experience I wanted to move into
              research and academia so I applied for a{" "}
              <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/course/phd-doctorate/postgraduate-research-in-business-and-management">
                doctoral studentship at UEA &#40;within the Norwich Business

              </a>{" "}
              gaining a role on their Graduate Teaching Assistant scheme.
              Although I enjoyed my time on this programme, I left in November
              2021 after deciding to transition back into industry to pursue a
              career. I am currently working at{" "}
              <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/">
                Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment
              </a>{" "}

            Outside of work I enjoy both watching and participating in sports -
            I play for a local rugby team, have run the 2022 London Marathon,
            and support Norwich City Football Club. I am also a member of the
            National Trust and spend most weekends visiting their sites.
